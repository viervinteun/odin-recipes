        <h1>Vier's Personal Comfort Recipe for Lazy Times!</h1>

        <p>
            These recipes are the dishes I often cook for myself for many different lazy (<em>or greedy</em>) occasions. They're also not for people who've never cooked before. You'll see why below!
        </p>

        <p> 
            The recipes are very <strong>loose and asian style</strong>, meaning there's a lot of wiggle room for your own personal touch and the measurements are all based on the quotes "to taste" and "stop when your ancestors tell you to."
