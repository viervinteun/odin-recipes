            Yep, salad. I hope you're not running away from your greens. Eat them! That said, they do make for a really good crunchy snack.
        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            No-cook snack that's delicious, crunchy and healthy!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One or two head of lettuce, <a href="../images/lettuce-type.jpg">any kind</a>, personally I recommend Romaine, butterhead or little gem lettuce</li>
            <li>Preferred salad sauce</li>
        <br>
            <strong>Optional Ingredients:</strong>
            <li>Cherry tomatoes, optional</li>
            <li>Cheese, parmesan and cheddar works</li>
            <li>Olive or sesame oil</li>
            <li>Egg, just the white parts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            You can stop at any point or skip parts in this recipe after the lettuce to suit your personal taste.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Strip your lettuce head by hand if it's still a whole head. Chop them into big bite pieces.</li>
            <li>Cut your cherries in half.</li>
            <li>Cut the cheddar cheese into small cubes.</li>
            <li>Toss the lettuce, cherry and cheddar into a bowl and drizzle in the salad dressing. You can make your own, use premades like kewpie salad dressing or use simple sauces like mayonaise. Personally, I use 2:1 ratio with kewpie roasted sesame sauce and mayonaise.</li>
            <li>add a very light drizzle of olive oil and you're done!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            There you have it, a nice simple salad to snack on! If you're not going to finish it all in one go, put them in the fridge to enjoy all day.
