        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Shred the cheese.</strong> Do this first and foremost! Pre-shredded cheese doesn't taste as good as freshly shredded, but <em>they'll do the job in a pinch.</em></li>
            <li>
                <strong>Boil the macaroni.</strong> Bring a pot to a boil, add a pinch of salt to water, and cook pasta for about 8-10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Strain your pasta.</strong> Make sure to leave a little pasta water in the pot. We need that starch!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add butter, then milk, cheese and flour.</strong> Turn the head to medium-low. Butter first, about a tablespoon of it. Stir until melted. Add a cup of milk, cold, and then the cheese. Quickly add a tablespoon of flour after and constantly stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Final touches, salt and black pepper.</strong> Give your dish a bit of a taste. Adjust the flavor to your liking with black pepper and salt (<em>if needed</em>). This is when you should add in the mozzarella cheese and minced parsley. Mix everything until nicely incorporated together.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Plate and serve.</strong> If you choose to top with parmesan, dust it here. You can use a bowl or a plate, the only difference is that putting it in a plate will make it cool faster, which might be important to some people and vice versa.</li>
        <br>
            Look doesn't really matter, the taste does!
        </ol>

        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
        <br>
            If you are vegan, use margarin and cold oatmilk (<em>or other substitute milk, this one works best</em>) and add double or more the flour to the mixture. Use no cheese. Give it a bit more salt. It should work!
