            <ol>
                <li>Heat the wok or frying pan, put oil in, wait until oil swishes like water.</li>
                <li>Add garlic in first, stir for a moment or two.</li>
                <li>Toss the noodles, a teaspoon of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Dump everything else into the pan or wok. Use spatula to toss it around and mix evenly.</li>
                <li>mix a spoon of cornstarch with cold water until it becomes liquid, mix with the stir fry.</li>
                <li>Add soy and oyster sauce to taste. Start with half a tablespoon of each and keep tasting and adding little by little until it taste just right. This may include salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Make sure everything is nicely cooked before plating.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Simple cooking steps isn't it? Nothing like a cooking that's mostly just throwing everything into the pan after cutting them.
